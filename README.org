* Gnorb

Glue code between the Gnus, Org, and BBDB packages for Emacs.

This package connects Emacs-based email, project management, and
contact management a little more closely together. The goal is to
reduce friction when manipulating TODOs, contacts, messages, and
files.

Probably the most interesting thing Gnorb does is tracking
correspondences between Gnus email messages and Org headings. Rather
than "turning your inbox into a TODO list", as some software puts it,
Gnorb (kind of) does the opposite: turning your TODO headings into
mini mailboxes.

*NOTE*: Development of this package has moved to the [[http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/gnorb.html][Elpa repository]]
as of March 2017, and the code here will no longer be updated. You're
still welcome to open issues here, though pull requests won't work,
obviously. You can also call `report-emacs-bug' from within emacs. If
it prompts for a package, enter "gnorb". If it doesn't, please cc the
report to eric@ericabrahamsen.net.
