  "This option controls how `gnorb-org-handle-mail' scans the
subtree under point for links, and what it does with the links it
finds. It is a list of up to three elements, representing three
different scanning strategies. The first is used when calling the
function with no prefix arg; the second is used with a single
\\[universal-argument], and the third with a double
\\[universal-argument]. You can thus prepare different scanning
strategies in advance, and choose whichever is appropriate.

Each \"strategy\" will usually be a list of two items. The first
item determines how the heading's state-change notes are scanned,
the second item governs how the heading's body text is scanned.
If the scan of the state notes produces usable links, the second
item will be disregarded -- the rest of the heading won't be
scanned at all. This is because, if you're responding to message
links in the state-notes, they probably represent later messages
in an ongoing conversation. If you want a particular strategy to
always skip the state notes, just set the first item to nil.

The state specification is an alist with two possible keys: :type
and :scope. The :type key can be set to either 'state or 'note,
which means the scanning process will only consider logdrawer
items of one sort or the other. Setting the key to anything
lese (or leaving it out) means both state-change notes and
regular notes will be scanned. The :scope key controls how many
items will be scanned. Set to a positive integer to scan that
many items. The symbol 'first is a synonym for 1. The symbol
'first-link means scan each state note until one containing links
is found, and use only links from that item. The symbol 'all
means scan all state notes.

The second specification is used when the state-notes scan
produces no results, or was skipped with a nil specification.
This second item can be 0, meaning only scan the text of the
heading itself; a positive integer, meaning scan that many
paragraphs of body text; the symbol 'text, meaning scan the
entire body text; or the symbol 'subtree, meaning scan the
heading's text and all its subtrees.

Instead of a two-value specification, a strategy can just be a
single symbol: 'all will scan both the state notes and the body
text, and 'offer will collect all the links in the entire subtree
and pop up a buffer allowing the user to choose which links to
act on [this is a lie, 'offer hasn't been implemented yet].

Lastly, any of the elements can be a symbol representing a custom
function. When placed in the state-log or body-text
specifications, the function will be called in a temporary buffer
containing only the text of the state-log drawer, or the body
text, respectively. If the entire strategy is replaced by a
function name, that function will be called with point at the
beginning of the heading. Custom functions can use the internal
function `gnorb-scan-links' to return the appropriate alist of
links.

If `gnorb-org-handle-mail' is called while the region is active,
this variable will be disregarded entirely, and only the active
region will be scanned for links. If you call
`gnorb-org-handle-mail' with a prefix argument while the region
is active, it will look for links everywhere _but_ the active
region.

If all that sounds confusing, consider the default value:

'(((:type state :scope first-link) 1)
  (nil text)
  offer)

With no prefix arg, `gnorb-org-handle-mail' will look into the
logbook, and look at each state log item (skipping regular notes)
until it finds a state log with links in it, then operate on all
the links in that log item. If it finds nothing in the drawer, it
will scan the text of the heading, and the first paragraph of
body text.

With one prefix arg, it will always ignore the state-change
notes, instead scanning the heading and the entirety of its body
text.

With two prefix args, it will simply offer all the links in the
subtree for selection.")
