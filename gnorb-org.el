When triggering an Org heading after receiving or sending a

actions include:

todo state: Associate the message, and change TODO state.
take note: Associate the message, and take a note.
don't associate: Do nothing at all, don't connect the message and TODO.
only associate: Associate the message with this heading, do nothing else.
capture to child: Associate this message with a new child heading.
capture to sibling: Associate this message with a new sibling heading.

You can reorder this list or remove items as suits your workflow.
The two \"capture\" options will use the value of
`gnorb-gnus-new-todo-capture-key' to find the appropriate

symbol indicating a custom function.  The custom function will be
called on the heading in question, and passed a plist containing
information about the message from which we're triggering."

  "Handle current headline as a mail TODO.

How this function behaves depends on whether you're using Gnorb
for email tracking, also on the prefix arg, and on the active
region.

If tracking is enabled and there is no prefix arg, Gnorb will
begin a reply to the newest associated message that wasn't sent
by the user -- ie, the Sender header doesn't match
`user-mail-address' or `message-alternative-emails'.

If tracking is enabled and there is a prefix arg, ignore the
tracked messages and instead scan the subtree for mail-related
links. This means links prefixed with gnus:, mailto:, or bbdb:.
See `gnorb-org-mail-scan-scope' to limit the scope of this scan.
Do something appropriate with the resulting links.

With a double prefix arg, ignore all tracked messages and all
links, and compose a blank new message.

If tracking is enabled and you want to reply to a
specific (earlier) message in the tracking history, use
`gnorb-org-view' to open an nnir *Summary* buffer containing all
the messages, and reply to the one you want. Your reply will be
automatically tracked, as well.

If tracking is not enabled and you want to use a specific link in
the subtree as a basis for the email action, then put the region
around that link before you call this message."
